# Data Science Test Solution

## Data manipulation problem
The solution can be found in `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Files\DataManipulation.ipynb` [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/CesarArroyo09/Data-Science-Test-Solution/blob/main/Solution_Files/DataManipulation.ipynb). The final result is in `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Data\data_manipulation_merged_df.csv`.

## SQL problem
The solution can be found in `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Files\SQLTest.ipynb` [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/CesarArroyo09/Data-Science-Test-Solution/blob/main/Solution_Files/SQLTest.ipynb). The SQL file with commands used can be found on `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Files\SQLTest.sql`.

## Binary classification problem
The solution can be found in `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Files\BinaryClassificator.ipynb` [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/CesarArroyo09/Data-Science-Test-Solution/blob/main/Solution_Files/BinaryClassificator.ipynb). The final result is in `Data Science Test Solution\Solution_Data\test_evaluado.csv`.

## Extra problem
Since I didn't have time to finish the 4th problem here is a link from a previous work that I did on a Kaggle competitition. Feel free to check and ask any questions when the time comes.
